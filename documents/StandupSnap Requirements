StandupSnap – Product Requirements Specification 
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document defines requirements for standupSnap, an application intended to streamline capturing and structuring daily standup updates. Free-form text is processed using an AI model to format updates into done, to-do, and blockers.
1.2 Scope
The system supports agile elements such as projects, sprints, teams, cards, snaps, estimated timelines (ET), and RAG status.
Scrum masters, product owners, and PMO may work across multiple projects and can switch project context.
Snaps may be generated only while a sprint is active.
RAG suggestion logic activates once ET is defined, even when no snaps have been recorded.
1.3 Actors
Scrum master
Product owner
PMO
Team member
Team members do not interact directly with the system in MVP.
2. High level overview
StandupSnap enables scrum masters to manage projects, teams, sprints, and cards.
Updates (snaps) are captured as raw English text and converted into structured segments.
Each card may have multiple snaps across a sprint.
Cards must maintain ET dates to drive automated RAG suggestion. Final RAG is always controlled by the scrum master.
Snaps may be captured on any day while a sprint is active but cannot be created after the sprint closes.
Scrum masters may lock a day’s snaps and export a daily summary including RAG.
Scrum masters, PO, PMO may belong to multiple projects and switch between them.
