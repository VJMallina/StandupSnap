7.6 Card Life Cycle Management
Section	Details
Module #	7 – Card Management
Use Case ID	M7-UC06
Use Case Name	Card Lifecycle Management
Trigger	System or Scrum Master (SM) action that updates card state
Pre-conditions	1. User authenticated 2. Sprint = Active 3. Card exists with valid ET and assignee
Basic Path (Main Flow)	1. SM creates a new card → System sets state = Not Started. 2. When the SM logs the first snap for the card → System auto-transitions Not Started → In Progress. 3. When SM decides the card is fully completed → SM clicks Mark as Completed → System sets state = Completed. 4. When Sprint is closed → System transitions all Completed cards to Closed. 5. Closed cards become fully read-only.
Alternative Paths	Condition 1: SM marks a card as Completed directly from Not Started state → Allowed. Condition 2: Sprint close attempted with cards in Not Started / In Progress → System blocks sprint close. Condition 3: Attempt to edit card details or snaps in Completed/Closed state → Blocked. Condition 4: Attempt to add snaps after completion → Blocked.
Post-conditions	1. Card always remains in one of four valid lifecycle states. 2. RAG value remains unchanged when card is marked Completed. 3. All cards must reach Completed before sprint closure. 4. Closed cards become permanently read-only in MVP.

Business Validations	1. Only SM can manually change card state to Completed. 2. System auto-transitions Not Started → In Progress on first snap. 3. Snap creation allowed only when card is Not Started or In Progress. 4. RAG is preserved when Completed (no auto-green). 5. Completed cards cannot revert to earlier states (MVP). 6. Inactive/Closed cards cannot be modified. 7. Sprint cannot close unless all cards = Completed.
Notes	Card lifecycle directly affects sprint closure and RAG reporting. Future releases may introduce more states.

8) Snap Management
8.1 Add raw snap for a card
Section	Details
Module #	8 – Snap Management
Use Case ID	M8-UC01
Use Case Name	Create Snap (Daily Update)
Trigger	SM opens a card in an Active sprint and selects “Add Snap”
Pre-conditions	1. User authenticated 2. An Active Sprint is selected 3. Card belongs to the Active Sprint 4. Sprint is NOT Completed or Closed 5. User roles:  • SM → Full access  • PO → Read snaps only (no creation)  • PMO → Read-only 6. Card must have ET specified 7. Card must not be deleted
Basic Path (Main Flow)	1. SM navigates to Sprint → Snap Management → Today 
2. SM opens the card and clicks Add Snap 
3. System displays prior context: 
 ✔ Yesterday’s Snap (expanded) if available 
 ✔ Older Snaps (collapsed) under “View Full History”3. System displays snap input area:  • Free-text field where SM writes the update in normal English 4. SM enters update text and clicks Generate Snap 5. System sends content to AI model 6. AI processes update and converts into structured output:  • Done (what is completed)  • To Do (next planned work)  • Blockers (if any detected) 7. AI also analyzes:  • Timeline progress vs ET  • Content tone for blockers  • Implicit delays  • Work momentum 8. System generates RAG suggestion for SM (not auto-applied):  • Green: On track  • Amber: At risk  • Red: Off track 9. SM sees AI output + suggested RAG 10. SM can:  • Accept AI output as-is  • Edit Done/ToDo/Blockers manually  • Override RAG if necessary 11. SM clicks Save Snap 12. System saves structured snap to the card’s history 13. Card’s final RAG is updated (SM-decided) 14. System shows “Snap created successfully.”
Alternative Paths	Condition 1 — Sprint Completed → Block: “Cannot create snaps after sprint completion.” Condition 2 — Sprint Closed → Block: “This sprint is closed. Snap creation disabled.” Condition 3 — Card has no ET → Block: “ET required to create snap.” Condition 4 — AI parsing fails → System shows: “Could not process text. Submit again or edit manually.” → SM can input Done/To Do/Blockers manually Condition 5 — PMO/PO tries to add snap → “You don’t have permission to add snaps.” Condition 6 — System error → “Unable to save snap.”
Post-conditions	1. Snap saved as today’s update 
2. RAG updated based on AI + SM override 
3. Snap visible in today’s snap group 
4. Older snaps remain in collapsed history
5. Daily standup summary (overall snap) can pick this up after snap lock

1. Only SM can create snaps 
2. Snap only for “today” allowed 
3. Each snap timestamped
