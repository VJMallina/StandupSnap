System loads the Daily Heatmap View for the selected week 3. System displays a GitHub-style 5-day or 7-day grid, depending on settings:   • Monday → Friday (default)   • Optionally include Saturday/Sunday (future setting) 4. For each day, system shows a colored square, where color = daily load intensity:    Low load (<60%)    Medium load (60–100%)    High load (>100%)    No data (neutral) 5. Hovering on a day shows a tooltip with:   • Date   • Availability   • Workload (distributed or default split)   • Daily Load% 6. If the system uses auto-distribution (MVP behavior), it divides weekly workload into equal daily slices (unless modified manually in future updates). 7. User can click a day cell to open a Daily Detail Panel (future expansion):   • Notes   • Constraints   • Override daily values (not MVP) 8. Breadcrumb updates to: January → Week 2 → Daily View Alternative Paths A. Weekly workload is 0 → All day squares display grey/neutral B.
